# Scholarship Management API

**Description:**
An API project designed to manage a scholarship system, allowing registered users to perform various actions based on their roles. As a provider, users can add, delete, and update scholarships, while seekers can read scholarships, add them to their favorite list, and view their favorite list. The system employs JWT Token Authentication for secure user access.

**Project Scope:**
This project involves the development of a robust Scholarship Management API. The API serves as a comprehensive platform for managing scholarships, catering to two main user roles: Providers and Seekers. Providers can perform actions such as adding, deleting, and updating scholarships, ensuring seamless administration. Seekers, on the other hand, can access scholarship information, add scholarships to their favorites, and review their favorite list. The entire system is secured through JWT Token Authentication to guarantee user access control and data protection.
